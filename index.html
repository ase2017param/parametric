<h1>Efficient Probabilistic Model Checking of Evolving Software Systems</h1>
<p>Abstract: This “new ideas” paper introduces a method for the efficient compositional verification of reliability, performance and other quality-of-service (QoS) properties of evolving software systems using parametric probabilistic model checking (PMC). Unlike existing parametric PMC solutions, which can only handle changes in the system parameters, our new method supports structural system changes by exploiting domain-specific modelling patterns for the system components. The method precomputes closed-form expressions for key QoS properties of such patterns, and then handles structural system changes by efficiently integrating these expressions into easy-to-evaluate algebraic formulae for the QoS properties of the modified system. The paper presents the main steps of our method, its successful application to service-based systems, and potential uses in other application domains.</p>
